# Hi there, I'm Abdullah Ahmad 👋 :eyeglasses:

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently working on AI based unmanned crop maintainance system

learning Machine learning and Deep learning 🔭

open to collaborate on challenging projects 

## 👯 Skills
although I am still learning but here is a collection of my skills. 😄🌱
- Python
- NLP
- Computer Vision
- MLOPS
- Tensorflow/Pytorch

## 🛠️ Projects
- Project 1: [AI based crop maintainance UGV](https://github.com/Ali4real/AI-based-crop-maintenance-system) - Developed a disease detection and spraying robot that automatically detects and sprays the pesticide. 
Used precise agriculture and targeted spraying for efficient utilization of resources. The dataset used for this project is collected from the premises of TObacco field in Swabi, Pakistan. the images were annotated manually.


- Project 2: [Sentiment analysis on Roman text using LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabahmad19/sentiment-analysis-lstm) - Leveraged the power of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) a neural network architecture that can work on textual data by holding the context chat. 
Used word embedding to represent the textual data in a geometric space.


- Project 3: [Dog breed classifier using transfer learning](https://github.com/iabahmad/pre-trained-image-classifier-to-identify-do-breeds) - Developed a classifies to detect falsified entries in system by classifying the images.


- Project 4: [Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGloun](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/e/b9f6292c-ee8f-11ed-8ddc-57f019dd3d3a) - Associated with Machine learning fundamentals nanodegree at Udacity
