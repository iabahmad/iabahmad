# Hello, World! I'm Abdullah Ahmad 👋 :eyeglasses:

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, but you might also call me an AI enthusiast, a code wizard, or a lifelong learner!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently diving deep into the world of AI, working on an unmanned crop maintenance system. It's all about Machine Learning and Deep Learning here! 🔭

I'm always on the lookout for challenging projects to collaborate on. So if you're looking for someone who loves a good challenge, you're in the right place!

## 🎩 Skills
I'm still on my learning journey, but here's a sneak peek into my toolbox:

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- MLOPS
- Tensorflow/Pytorch

## 🛠️ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. [Cryp-bot](https://github.com/iabahmad/Cryp-bot) - A cryptocurrency trading bot that automates trading strategies.

2. [AI based crop maintenance UGV](https://github.com/Ali4real/AI-based-crop-maintenance-system) - A disease detection and spraying robot that's revolutionizing agriculture. 

3. [Bringing Faraz Words to Life](https://github.com/iabahmad/poetry-generator.git) - A poetry generator that is still improving itself

4. [Sentiment analysis on Roman text using LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabahmad19/sentiment-analysis-lstm) - Leveraging the power of LSTM to understand the sentiment behind texts.

5. [Dog breed classifier using transfer learning](https://github.com/iabahmad/pre-trained-image-classifier-to-identify-do-breeds) - A classifier that can identify dog breeds. Perfect for those "what breed is that cute dog?" moments!

6. [Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGloun](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/e/b9f6292c-ee8f-11ed-8ddc-57f019dd3d3a) - A project associated with the Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree at Udacity.
